# Strategic-Allocation-of-Aid
Categorizing the countries based on socio-economic and health factors using ML techniques

# Overview of the project
In todayâ€™s world, many countries face severe economic and health issues. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) like HELP
International work to help these countries in dire need of aid. However, it is crucial for HELP International to prioritize its aid
and allocate its resources effectively. With a budget of 10 million dollars, HELP International needs to determine which countries
are in the direst need of aid. Our task is to categorize the countries based on socio-economic and health factors that determine
their overall development. This categorization will enable HELP International to identify the countries that require immediate
assistance and allocate resources accordingly.Our approach involves collecting and analyzing data on various socio-economic and
health factors, such as GDP, life expectancy, infant mortality rate, literacy rate, and poverty rate. We will then use machine
learning algorithms to cluster the countries based on these factors.
